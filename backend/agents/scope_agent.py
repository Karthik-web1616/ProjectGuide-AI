CrewAI Scope Definition Agent

in-scope / out-of-scope items, target users, deliverables, assumptions,

Define a clear, bounded scope for the following student academic project idea.

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Title: {title}
- Description: {desc}
- Domain: {domain}
- Team Size: {team_size} members
- Duration: {duration_days} days ({round(int(duration_days) / 7)} weeks approx.)
- Proposed Technologies: {tech_ideas if tech_ideas else 'Not specified'}
- Key Features Mentioned:
{features_text}

STUDENT SKILL PROFILE:
{skills_text}
{file_section}
{feas_chain_section}

INSTRUCTIONS:
You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON object (no extra text, no markdown) with exactly this structure:
{{
  "problemStatement": "<one clear paragraph stating the specific problem this project solves>",
  "objectives": ["<objective 1>", "<objective 2>", "<objective 3>"],
  "inScope": ["<in-scope item 1>", "<in-scope item 2>", "<in-scope item 3>"],
  "outOfScope": ["<explicitly excluded item 1>", "<explicitly excluded item 2>"],
  "targetUsers": "<who this project is built for>",
  "keyDeliverables": ["<deliverable 1>", "<deliverable 2>"],
  "assumptions": ["<assumption 1>", "<assumption 2>"],
  "constraints": ["<constraint 1>", "<constraint 2>"],
  "metrics": {{
    "clarity": <integer 0-100: how precisely the problem statement is defined>,
    "scopeControl": <integer 0-100: how well scope creep is prevented by the out-of-scope list>,
    "achievability": <integer 0-100: how realistic this scope is for {team_size} students in {duration_days} days>,
    "completeness": <integer 0-100: how complete and specific all sections are>
  }}
}}

GUIDELINES:
- The scope MUST be realistic for a team of {team_size} students within {duration_days} days.
- "inScope" should list only what can genuinely be built in that time.
- "outOfScope" must explicitly call out tempting features/extensions that should be deferred, so the team doesn't drift into scope creep.
- If Agent 1 Feasibility Report is provided, ensure the scope directly addresses those bottlenecks.
- Be specific and reference the actual project details — avoid generic filler.
- If uploaded reference documents were provided, incorporate relevant details from them.
